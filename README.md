enums by an Article, Client and Request classes.

An elementary scheme of the functioning of delegates is being implemented:
There is a Vector class into which an array of integers is passed. 
The user can pass a numerical operation (for example, the sum of elements or their product). 
The action is executed and the result is returned.
